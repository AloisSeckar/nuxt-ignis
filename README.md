## Nuxt Stack
This is my current setup I'd use to start new "real world" [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) webapp. 
This will improve and grow together with my skills.
I will also try to include **WHAT** and **WHY** comments.

### Features
- Nuxt application framework atop Vue.js
- VueUse for utility functions
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- NuxtImage to optimize use of images
- nuxt/i18n for localization
- Pinia for state management
- Supabase for auth and DB services
- FormKit for input forms
- Ic√¥nes for providing SVG icons
- ESLint via @nuxt/eslint for automatic code quality check

### How to use
1. `git checkout nuxt-stack project`)
2. `npm install`
3. `setup supabase` (optional)
4. `npm run dev` 
5. `localhost:3000` 

You are ready to build your next awesome project in Nuxt.
