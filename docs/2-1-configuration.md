# Configuration
It is possible to select which Nuxt modules and other features will be activated in your project. All dependencies are being downloaded into local `node_modules`, but Nuxt build process will ensure only relevant packages will be bundled for production.

The "magic" is done via environment variables, which you can set in your `.env` file or directly in your hosting provider's settings.

## Core features
